# PROJECT_STATE.md — where the build is right now

The agent updates this file at the end of every `/build-next` run. Keep it short and factual.

## Step status
Statuses: `todo` · `in_progress (part k of n)` · `blocked` · `done`

## Current tier
Tier 1: Skeleton, packaging, config, telemetry, API & security baseline complete.

## Done
- Starter repo: rules, autopilot workflows, spec, config, folder layout, placeholder corpus, demo scenarios, docs templates, repo-rule tests.
- Step 01: Kickoff plan artifact produced covering goals, hard rules, security rules, corpus profiling, sequence map, MVP scope, risk matrix, and open decisions.
- Step 02: `pyproject.toml`, MIT `LICENSE`, `Makefile`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, Pydantic Settings config loader (`kairos/config.py`), Pydantic v2 strict schemas (`kairos/schemas.py`), telemetry engine (`kairos/telemetry/`), thin LLM provider interface (`kairos/llm/`), FastAPI `/v1` app with health/ready probes & security headers (`kairos/api/`), `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml`, 27 unit & security integration tests passing.

## Next
Step 03: `build/steps/p02-index.md`. Type `/build-next` in a new conversation.

## Known issues
- The real corpus has not been supplied yet; using the placeholder corpus (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`).
